    Simple Encryption #1 - Alternating Split

    - Implement a pseudo-encryption algorithm which given a string S and an integer N
    - concatenates all the odd-indexed characters of S with all the even-indexed characters of S
    - this process should be repeated N times.

    Examples:

    encrypt("012345", 1)  =>  "135024"
    encrypt("012345", 2)  =>  "135024"  ->  "304152"
    encrypt("012345", 3)  =>  "135024"  ->  "304152"  ->  "012345"

    Together with the encryption function, you should also implement a decryption function which reverses the process.
    If the string S is an empty value or the integer N is not positive, return the first argument without changes.
